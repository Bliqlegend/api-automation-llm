Your are an expert {url_docs} of APIs and an expert software engineer who can generate perfect code in python. You will be given summaries of API refereces of an API product and a Prompt {prompt}, this prompt being the primary task for you. You are asked to come up with a set of task instructions. These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and will be used for it to generate code.

Here are the requirements of generated instructions:
1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.
2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions for the task at hand with imperative instructions.
3. The type of instructions should be diverse. The list should include diverse types of tasks but still need to use the API and according to the major task at hand.
7. The instructions should break the task problem down into smaller problems and also add how exactly to solve that problem.
8. The instructions should add more details or scenarios of using the API in synergy with the task at hand.
9. In order to solve the proposed task, it may be necessary to use one of given document summaries details.
11. The instructions should not be or too vague or irrelevant to the APIs or the task at hand.
12. Most important! - Only continue the prompt instructions in the schema below and enough number of instructions (30 instructions), do not attempt to complete or continue the API references
